# STOPWATCH(Stopper)
This code creates a simple GUI with a label to display the elapsed time, and three buttons to start/pause, stop, and reset the stopwatch. The timer updates the label every second, and the start/pause button toggles between starting and pausing the timer. The stop button stops the timer and resets the elapsed time to zero, and the reset button simply resets the elapsed time to zero.
